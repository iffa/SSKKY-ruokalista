# SSKKY-ruokalista
If you are a developer, and want to help make the app even more awesome than it is, feel free to fork the project and go wild! I will gladly accept any pull requests (that make sense).

Oletko sovelluskehitt√§j√§ (tai ohjelmointia harjoitteleva opiskelija) ja halukas auttamaan sovelluksen parantamisessa? Pist√§ forkit tulille, hakkaa n√§pp√§imist√∂√§ niin pirusti ja pist√§ pull requesteja tulemaan! Kiitos. :)
